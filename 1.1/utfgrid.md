# UTFGrid

The UTFGrid encoding scheme encodes interactivity data for a tile in a space efficient manner. It is designed to be used in browsers, e.g. for displaying tooltips when hovering over certain features of a map tile.

Since slower browsers and machines can't cope with rendering the actual polygons used to draw vectors on the map tile, we use a grid-based approach where we store the associated information for each pixel.

UTFGrid uses JSON as a container format. It is exclusively geared towards square 256x256 pixel tiles.

## Grid

To achieve reasonable speed in browsers, we store information for a pixel in long strings, where each character's Unicode code point is the key for retrieving the information associated with that pixel. When we have less than 96 unique IDs, this means that the space taken up by storing each pixel separately is 256 * 256 = 64 KB. Gzipping the grid data typically reduces it to a size below 2K.

By default, UTFGrid operates on a 2x2 grid. This means that the maximum information resolution for a 256x256 tile is 128x128. If each pixel had different information, we require a 14 bit wide ID (2^14 = 16384). However, most tiles won't have that many IDs; they'll typically have a couple of dozens IDs. Therefore, we take advantage of UTF-8's variable length codepoint encoding: all ASCII characters are encoded as is, that means that the first 94 codepoints are encoded with their code number as a single byte (codes `0x20`, `0x21`, `0x23`-`0x5B` and `0x5D`-`0x7F`). IDs with a number larger than that will get encoded as multiple bytes.

## Encoding IDs

[JSON](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627) doesn't allow control characters, `"` and `\` to be encoded as their literal UTF-8 representation. **Encoding** an ID works as follows:

* Add 32<sub>10</sub>.
* If the result is >= 34<sub>10</sub>, add 1.
* If the result is >= 92<sub>10</sub>, add 1.

This ensures that all characters that cannot be represented natively are skipped.

**Decoding** works as follows:

* If the codepoint is >= 93<sub>10</sub>, subtract 1.
* If the codepoint is >= 35<sub>10</sub>, subtract 1.
* Subtract 32<sub>10</sub>.

## Mapping an ID to a key

The UTFgrid file contains an array in a property named `grid` at the root level. Each entry represents a row in the grid. Each array entry is a string that contains the UTF-8 encoded codepoint for each column. The string length corresponds to the number of entries in the `grid` array. Only powers of two are allowed.

The keys are stored in an array named `keys` at the root level. The index of each key represents the ID that it is associated to.

Retrieving a key from a coordinate works as follows (`json` is the root level object, `x` and `y` are the coordinates, starting from top left at 0, and `size` is the number of entries in the `grid` key):

* `var factor = 256 / size, row = y / factor, col = x / factor`
* `var id = json.grid[row].charCodeAt(col);` is the character that contains the encoded ID.
* Decode the id as described in *"Encoding IDs"*.
* `var key = json.keys[id];` retrieves the ID associated with the coordinate.

All divisions are integer divisions.

## Mapping a key to data

The JSON file may contain an optional `data` property at the root level. If it isn't present, the client looks up the obtained key in its internal data store. If the lookup key is not present, it queries the server with the missing keys. If the `data` property is present, but the key cannot be found, the client must behave as if there were no `data` property.

An empty key signifies the unavailability of information for that pixel. No action may be taken to retrieve data for an empty (`""`) key.

When minified and gzipped, the resulting file is 2071 bytes with the key to data mapping and 1645 bytes without.

To test implementations, [`demo.json`](https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec/blob/master/1.1/demo.json) contains a grid that consists of 65501 different keys. This is the maximum possible in this version of UTFGrid. Implementors should check that obtaining a a coordinate should return the key `y * 256 + x` for all x/y, with the exception of y = 255 and x >= 222 and x <= 255 returning 65501 due to the maximum codepoint allowed in JSON.

A dummy code validation routine is given here:

```javascript
json = JSON.parse(/* demo.json */);
var key = 0;
for (var y = 0; y < 256; y++) {
    for (var x = 0; x < 256; x++) {
        var code = json.grid[y].charCodeAt(x);
        if (code >= 93) code--;
        if (code >= 35) code--;
        code -= 32;

        assert(code == key) {

        if (key < 65501) key++;
    }
}
```
